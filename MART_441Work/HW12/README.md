# MART 441 ReadMe HW12

This week was interesting in how we were able to build on the concepts from the week before. Creating different objects was exciting and also working with JSON. Integrating the canvas and data aspect was helpful in understanding just all the thing one could do. I had some trouble uploading everything into the correct files but I believe it's working now after I deleted and redid it. New note: Yes, just checked back and it didn't upload because I think I forgot to push on Github desktop, thought it was just taking a long time. Let me know if you can't see it. I got a little lost and wasn't sure exactly how I was supposed to integrate the files from week 11 since the example looked totally different so I went off that but my squares weren't showing up and I couldn't test it.
