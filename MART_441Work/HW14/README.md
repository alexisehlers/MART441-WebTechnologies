# MART 441 Homework 14
This week went pretty smoothly, I worked through the material slowly andw as able to fully digest a lot of the concepts. I've found that working alongside the videos and watching them over again for reference really helped.The successes I had were making three shapes pop up and also the skull model, along with positioning them on the screen. I was only able to get two of the squares to rotate. I also downloaded a free obj object and tried to integrate it into my work but it gave me an error that my CORS was blocking it. I included it here. I even tried linking it locally and on GitHub but that didn't work. I think that using Three JS is a language with a lot of possibilities.
