# 441 README Homework 11
This week went rather well I fee, I was able to do almost everything that the assignment asked. What I had issues with was the red  square glitching out and not disappearing on one side of canvas. Also when I tried to add the variable for resizing when they collided it would make my squares disappear altogether. However, I did have some fun following along with the tutorials and making it all work for me. As the semester wraps up I am hoping to be able to submit the homework I missed and do more reading to make it all make more sense, I will be working on that this week.
