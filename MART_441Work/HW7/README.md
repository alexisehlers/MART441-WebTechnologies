# MART 441 Homework 7
I wasn't able to successfully complete this homework but I did have all the information I needed for the assignment. I was going to have my webpage display pictures and descriptions of moments from the Irish Independance movement. I couldnt figure out how to add the year/description and more to the corresponding sections so I just put it in the title. I got the title to work at least along with the button. Along with this I couldn't find anything clear about how to embed a image into an array so I wasn't able to get those to display. A little discouraged by this project as I spent many hours on it and didn't get it to work. Figured I wopuld turn in what I had at least.
