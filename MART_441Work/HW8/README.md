# MART 441 Homework 8
The homework this week Was challenging but it started to make more sense as I viewed the example. I'm still a bit fuzzy on the jQuery library and how to source it in my code. Also a bit confusing was how much of it I needed to write or if I just download it on jQuery. When looking at the class example I saw that the jQuery files were in the main directory under the homework folder but not in a lib folder. I couldn't get my triangle to show up and move on its own, just got lost in the sauce I guess. I want to look over the homework website and see if I can figure it out.
