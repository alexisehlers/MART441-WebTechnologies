# MART 441 ReadMe Homework 13
Whew! I had some problems with this one.... While I was able to change the gravity of the stars, add platforms and make my character jump with the spacebar I broke my code after awhile and my character wouldn't move. I deleted the hitBomb text and it started working again but now my ufo bomb guy won't show up. I also wanted to add a special star labeled a "prize" but each time I added it like the stars my live view would go white. I also wanted to add an alien sprite but I would only see a fragment of the sprite each time I did. I was a bit confused on frames and the sizing of the sprites. The background would just go white each time I tried to resize the stars background. I was also wondering if there was a way to change the color of the platforms? Something else weird is that the "S" in Score changed to uppercare with the first star collected. I also tried to add a timer but it didn't show up. With more time and research I might be able to get my code to work, I did have fun attempting the elements I did get to work.
