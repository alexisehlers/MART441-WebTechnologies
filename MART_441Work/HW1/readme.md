# 441 HW-1 Readme

This week's homework was a trial. Remembering all the little details to building a webpage was harder than I thought it would be! Since I'm more of a visual learner I used the HW-1 example as a template and once the stressful part of getting the elements in place was over, I started having fun! I can't wait to continue learning css, it's definitely my favorite so far. I'm hoping my version is different enough from the original, I was really lost. Exited for the next week and relearning a lot of forgotten skills.
