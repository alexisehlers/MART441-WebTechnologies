                <h1>Introduction to Alexis</h1>
                <p>Hi there! My name is Alexis Ehlers, I go by Lexi. I grew up in Kalispell in a large family of seven. I graduate this Spring and I'm so exited. While I do find these kind of classes challenging, I do think Web Tech is super useful to me in my career field and I look forward to implementing the skills learned from this class into my work.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h2>
        <div class="menu-group-container">
                    <div class="menu-item">A special skill I bring to the world of Web Technology is my creativity. I am an artist in quite a few mediums, my most recent being photography. I also do a bit of graphic design. While I haven't always worked in the creative field, my previous jobs ranging from lifeguarding to waitressing--I am now working for a magazine doing work that I love. What inspires me is travel, my Montanan life, and the great outdoors. I'll graduate with a double BFA in Media Arts and English and I plan to continue taking photos and maybe do a bit of traveling once I'm out of school. </div>

                <h1>Interests</h1>
                <p>I have a lot of interests, I can never focus on one. I love kayaking and swimming in Flathead Lake. I also read a lot and probably work too much. I've been writing some fiction works and want to finish a book someday. When I look at the world, I see so much possibility amid the chaos and darkness. I hope to find and be the light in the world, and impact people through my art.</p>
