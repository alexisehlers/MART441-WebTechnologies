 # 441 Homework 3 Read Me
 This week I had fun playing with the script of the story, and trying to make my code work. It was a lot of information but it felt great when I did get things to work. Something I struggled with was making my button work, I'm not sure exactly what I did wrong. Something about specifying an identifier was an error that came up. I took the name out of quotations and it worked after that! Something I'd like to work on in the future is the aesthetic aspects of my projects. The more I get into this class, the more I realize how much I should review a bit more of Intro to Web Design and Coding. Extra homework for next week!
